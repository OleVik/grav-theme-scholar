## Installation

### Grav Package Manager

The simplest way to install this theme is via the [Grav Package Manager (GPM)](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm) through your system's Terminal -- also called the command line. From the root of your Grav install type:

    bin/gpm install scholar

This will install the Scholar-theme into your `/user/themes` directory within Grav. Its files can be found under `/your/site/grav/user/themes/scholar`.

## Manual Installation

To install this theme, just download the zip version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/themes`. Then, rename the folder to `scholar`.

You should now have all the theme files under

    /your/site/grav/user/themes/scholar

This theme started as a clone of Paul Hibbitt's [Learn2 with Git Sync](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/grav-theme-learn2-git-sync)-theme, which is a customized version of the [Learn2](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-theme-learn2)-theme. As this theme decouples and supercedes much of the logic in either, it is rebranded as Scholar.
